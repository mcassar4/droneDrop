# DroneDrop: Lightweight Payload Delivery System

DroneDrop is a lightweight, ESP32-powered payload release mechanism designed for drones like the DJI Mini 3 Pro. Using a photoresistor for light detection and a servo motor for actuation, the system delivers payloads with precision. The custom 3D-printed housing ensures minimal weight impact while securely housing the components.

## Features
- **Microcontroller**: HELTEC ESP32.
- **Trigger System**: Photoresistor detects light signal to release the payload.
- **Lightweight Housing**: Custom 3D-printed enclosure tailored for my DJI Mini 3 Pro.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for reliable operation.

## Highlights
- Successfully tested with an egg drop payload.
- Compact and efficient design with minimal impact on drone performance.
- Open-source code and modular hardware design for easy replication or improvement.
